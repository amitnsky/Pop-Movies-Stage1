# Pop-Movies-Stage1

Project P1, I completed under Google-Udacity Scholarship Nanodegree program 2018, course code was nd801.

API KEY is removed from project, so it won't work untill you don't put your own key. 

Follow steps for initial project setup if you have your key 
-> gradle.properties 

#put your api key here
API_KEY="your api key here"

replace "paste api key here" with your API KEY. done.
